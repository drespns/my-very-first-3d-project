# Three.js Journey

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

Instead of doing `npm run build`, we are going to use **Vercel**.

- 'Modern' hosting solution
- Continuous integration (_CI_), automatisation of testing, deployment, etc.
- Developer friendly
- Easy setup
- For complex or simple projects

```bash
npm install vercel
```
